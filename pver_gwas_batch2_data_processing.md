## Data Prep

Download data, untar each archive, and check md5sums:

```bash
cd /RC/group/rc_barshis_lab/taxonarchive/2024-11-26_TxGenPverrucosa_batch2/

# untar archives
for file in `ls *.tar`; do
  echo $file
  tar -xf $file
  echo "Done extracting $file"
done


cd ./24392Brs_N24193

# check md5sums
md5sum -c MD5SUMS_24392Brs_N24193_L005.txt > md5checks.txt
```


Create sample table (fastq_table) and list (fastq_list):

Sample table columns (in order):

- `prefix` the prefix of raw fastq file names

- `lane_number` lane number; each sequencing lane or batch should be
  assigned a unique identifier. In this case it is "[run_ID]_[lane_id]"

- `seq_id` sequence ID; this variable is relevant when different
  libraries were prepared out of the same sample and were run in the
  same lane (e.g.Â if you wanted to include a replicate). In this case,
  seq_id should be used to distinguish these separate libraries. If you
  only have a single library prepared from each of your samples (even if
  you sequence that same library across multiple lanes), you can just
  put 1 for all samples in this column. In this case seq_id will refer to
  technical replicates of extracted DNA that we submitted to TxGen. These
  are given values of "1" or "2" (originally "A" and "B" in the submission
  sheet). Replicate libraries prepped by TxGen from the same submitted
  extract are denoted by the `prep_id` column (see below).

- `sample_id` sample ID; a unique identifier for each individual
  sequenced, e.g., "2024_FALU_Pver_01"

- `population` population name; the population or other relevant
  grouping variable that the individual belongs to, e.g., "FALU"

- `data_type` data type; there are only two allowed entries here: pe
  (for paired-end data) or se (for single end data). We need this in the
  table because for some of our processing steps, the commands are
  slightly different for paired-end and single-end data.

-`year` year samples were collected

-`project` project identifier, e.g., ASGWAS

-`location_id` numeric code for sampling location, e.g., "S01"

-`species` species abbreviation of the sampled individual/colony (as identified in the field), e.g., Pver

-`colony_id_by_location` genotype number within a sampling location (01-40)

-`tube_id` genotype number across all sampling locations (tube number)

-`prep_id` identifier for the round of libray preparation during which this library was made. To avoid avoid oversequencing, we asked TxGen to prep two separate libraries for each sample ("A" and "B"). Some samples failed in one prep but not the other and were reprepped in a third round, "C".

-`seq_project_id` vendor (TxGen)-assigned project number

-`run_id` ID assigned to the sequencing run by TxGen

-`lane_id` lane ID within a sequencing run (in this case L001 - L008)

-`vendor_id` ID assigned to the library by TxGen, e.g., "S421"

Make fastq_list:
``` bash
cut -f1 fastq_table_pver_gwas_batch2.txt | tail -n +2 > fastq_list_pver_gwas_batch2.txt

Assign starting environment variables and check environment and fastq_table:

SAMPLELIST=$BASEDIR/sample_lists/fastq_list_pver_gwas_batch2.txt

#Use a for loop to print the sample IDs for all sample files in your sample list:

for SAMPLEFILE in `cat $SAMPLELIST`; do   # Loop through each of the prefixes listed in our fastq list

    # For each prefix, extract the associated sample ID (column 4) and population (column 5) from the table
    SAMPLE_ID=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 4`
    POPULATION=`grep -P "${SAMPLEFILE}\t" $SAMPLETABLE | cut -f 5`
    echo $SAMPLEFILE refers to sample $SAMPLE_ID from $POPULATION

done
